## Usage

![Queen City Merge Usage](//raw.github.com/qcmerge/brand/master/usage/qcmerge-usage.png)

The `crown` mark should coupled with the `QC Merge` text as the primary means of identification. The `crown` by itself should only be used as an accent (like on a shirt) or in small spaces (like a Twitter icon).

- Primary Color: scarlet (#eb008b)
- Accent Colors: sand (#d3cfb1), black (#000000), and white (#ffffff)

# The Queen City Merge Brand

Queen City Merge was originally created as a uniquely different kind of web conference in 2012.

Charles Kingsleigh (from Alice in Wonderland):
> Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the impossible, is to believe it's possible

SO, that means we have to bring it to life uniquely. Bold, unexpected quirky, relevant, rich, odd, interesting, funny, engaging. Our goal should always be to look at things with new eyes. To be fearless, learn, fail and win.
